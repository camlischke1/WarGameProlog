# WarGameProlog
This program is written in Prolog  and is a simulation of the card game "War". Two players are each dealt hands of 26 cards, half the deck. Every round, both players flip their card. Whoever has the highest card wins and keeps the other person's card. If it is a tie, then both players flip 3 more cards face down, and then flip one last one to break the tie. The winner gets a point. The objective is to beat your opponent.  To start, using a Prolog interpreter, you must call the function start(). in the listener window.
